Given an array A of size N, Print the number of elements in A with sum of digits less than K.

Input Format

1st line contains 2 space-separated integers: N (the size of the array) and K.
2nd line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
1 ≤ K ≤ 81

Output Format

Output should be a single integer, denoting the number of elements in A with sum of digits less than K.

Sample Input 0

3 9
142 178 356 
Sample Output 0

1
Explanation 0

Sum of digits of 142 = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7
Sum of digits of 178 = 1 + 7 + 8 = 16
Sum of digits of 356 = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

Out of these 3 numbers, only one number - 142 has sum of digits less than 9.

Given a N x M matrix, print the water reflection of this matrix.
The water reflection of a matrix is its reflection in the water, which shows a vertically-inverted matrix.
A vertically-inverted matrix reflects the flipped top and bottom parts, while the left and right sides remain the same.

Input Format

1st line two space-separated integers, N and M denoting the size of matrix.
For next N lines, the ith line contains M space-separated integer denoting ith row of N x M matrix.

Constraints

1 ≤ N, M ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai,j ≤109, where Ai,j represents the element at ith and jth column of the matrix.

Output Format

Output an N x M matrix which is a water reflection of the input matrix.

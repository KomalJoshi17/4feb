Given an array of integers Arr of length N. Print the count of the triplets which form a non-degenerate triangle and satisfy the below conditions:
- Arri, Arrj, Arrk are pairwise distinct.
- i < j < k. (where i, j and k are indices of the array)

Note - A non-degenerate triangle is a triangle that has a positive area.

Input Format

1st line consists of N, which denotes the size of array.
2nd line consists of N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Arri <= 109, where Arri represents the element at ith index of the array.
Output Format

Output should be a single integer, denoting the count of triplets which form a non-degenerate triangle.

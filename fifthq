Given two strings A and B consisting of lowercase English letters. Choose any integer K and determine if A can be converted into B by shifting each character to the left by K.

For example, if K is 1
- character a shifted to left by 1 is z
- character b shifted to left by 1 is a
- character c shifted to left by 1 is b
- character z shifted to left by 1 is y

For example if K is 2
- character a shifted to left by 1 is y
- character b shifted to left by 1 is z
- character c shifted to left by 1 is a
- character z shifted to left by 1 is x

Input Format

1st line of input consists of string A.
2nd line of input consists of string B.

Constraints

1 <= length of A <= 105
1 <= length of B <= 105
length of A = length of B
'a' <= Ai, Bi <= 'z', where Ai, Bi represent characters at ith index of string A and B respectively.

Output Format

Print Yes if you can convert A to B. Else print No.
